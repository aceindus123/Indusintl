The prestigious high school houses a rigorous academic program that is designed for highly motivated and talented students. These competitive programs provide an excellent environment for student to learn and explore far beyond what a regular high school usually can provide. The application process is very similar to college application and students need to submit (1) application form, (2) middle school grade report, (3) teacher recommendations, and (4) passing a very competitive battery test that covers mathematics, verbal and reading comprehension, and an essay. The entrance test is usually held in the early December (the first Saturday in December). Thomas Jefferson Science Magnet accepts approximately 400 ― 430 students in total, while Montgomery Blair Magnet, Richard Montgomery IB and Poolesville Magnet accept 100 students each. The average acceptance ratio is about 10% of total participating students.

This prep course runs 16 weeks long, plus five (5) full practice tests that usually are held on Sunday.  The class meets for three hours. The class time is equally divided for Mathematics and Verbal, i.e. 1.5 hours for Mathematics and 1.5 hours for Verbal and writing. Homework is an important part of the prep program and will be assigned weekly. Students are expected to complete their homework prior to the next class. All students are required to take a placement test on the first day of the class (check the calendar for the time and date of placement test). The placement test is not a prerequisite to enrol but an assessment of student’s ability level. Practice test is a key part of this prep class and also serves as a tool for student to track their progress. Students are expected to attend all practice test session as scheduled.&nbsp;<br />
